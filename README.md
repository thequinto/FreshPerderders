## Overview

FreshPotatoes.com is a wiki-based website for films and artists.  

The FreshPotatoes team has defined a RESTful API endpoint they want you to build. The endpoint will allow external partners, like Netflix, to access FreshPotato artist and film data.

In this README, you'll find information about:

## What To Build

Build a recommendations API endpoint that retrieves top-rated film recommendations.  

#### User Story

*"As a developer, who doesn't work for FreshPotatoes, I want to use the FreshPotatoes API to get a list of recommended films related to one film."*

#### Acceptance Criteria

1) Recommended films must have:
  * The same genre as the parent film
  * A minimum of 5 reviews
  * An average rating greater than 4.0
  * Been released within 15 years, before or after the parent film
  * A sort order based on film id (order by film id)

2) The application should allow developers to:
  * Paginate by offset
  * Limit the number of returned records

3) The application should handle for:
  * Client/server failure
  * Missing routes

## FreshPotatoes Technologies

#### Codebase

The FreshPotatoes API service will be separate from their customer-facing web application.  In this repo, you'll find the code that will power their API: starter code built with Maven, Java 8, Spring Boot, JPA, and SQLite.

#### Database

The database schema is also provided via entity-relationship diagram. To interact with the database: `$ sqlite3 db/database.db`.

</p>


#### Third-Party API

The FreshPotatoes database has been developed using film data from a third-party service where fans can write reviews about their favorite movies.  

As part of this project, you must use this API to access film review data.  The third-party API is documented [here](third-party-api.md).

#### Relevant Documentation

* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/guides/)
* [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/)
* [JPA](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)

## What To Turn In

The FreshPotatoes tech team will look for:

* **A git repository** - Once you've downloaded the codebase, initiate a git repository.  As you work, make logical, frequent commits and descriptive commit messages.

* **Production-level code**. - As you implement your solution, think about maintainability, extensibility, security, and performance.

* **Consistent code**. To the best of your abilities, adhere to the [styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) provided.
